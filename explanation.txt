SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
- Checks if the email is sent from an authorized server for that domain.

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
- Adds a digital signature to verify the email content is not changed.

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance)
- Combines SPF and DKIM results to detect fake or spoofed emails.

Result:
SPF = PASS
DKIM = FAIL (minor changes due to forwarding)
DMARC = PASS
Hence, the email is NOT spoofed.
